# Hacker Scripts
> For us noobs



!!!danger "SOME OF THESE SCRIPTS WILL RUIN YOUR COMPUTER!!"
    Listen. I know you want to become a *1337 haxx0r* and all, but seriously, **don't run
    these scripts on your main machine**. Use a box you can blow up with malware, or a cheap Linode server, or like I do, a VM. But **DON'T BE STUPID**. **USE WITH CAUTION**.

    Also, **THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. I am not responsible for whatever happens if you break shit or get arrested for being stupid. I will be making a license, etc, soon.




## Where are them scripts??

Glad you asked. They are broken up into several directories, and majority of these scripts are written in Python.

```
/scritps
├── 📁 network-chuck
|  ├── 📁 ransomeware
|    ├── 📄 somescript.py
|    └── 📄 anothernastyboy.py
   ├── 📁 anotherdir
      ├── 📄 somemorescripts.py
|     └── 📄 hacktheplanet.py
├── 📄 LICENSE
├── 📄 README.md
```

Unless otherwise stated, I wrote these scripts with the instruction of YouTube channels. When I get better at this, I will create my own.

However, note that I am not content to just write these down; no no. Ya girl is going to *refactor* them and *test* on my VMs.

## More info please!

I do more detailed writing on https://0x8c.org.
